Challenge: Non-Constructible Change
Level: Easy

Given an array of positive integers representing the value of coins in your
possesion, write a function that returns the minimum amount of change (the
minimum sum of money) that you cannot create. The given coins have any positive
integer value and aren't necessarily unique.
For Example:
coins = [1, 2, 5], the minimum amount of change that you can't create is 4. If
you were given no coins, the minimum amount of change that you can't create is
1.

Input:
[5, 7, 1, 1, 2, 3, 22]

Output:
20
