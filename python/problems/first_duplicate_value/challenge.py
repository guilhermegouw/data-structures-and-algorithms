Challenge: First Duplicate Value
Level: Medium

Given an array of integers between 1 and n, inclusive, where n is the lenght
of the array, write a function that returns the first integer that appears more
than once (when the array is read from left to right).
In other words, out of all integers that might occur more than once in the
input array, your function should return the one whose first duplicate value
has the minimum index.
If no integer appears more than once, your function should return -1.

Note: You're allowed to mutate the input array.

Input 1:
array = [2, 1, 5, 2, 3, 3, 4]

Output 1:
2

Input 2:
array = [2, 1, 5, 3, 3, 2, 4]

Output 2:
3
