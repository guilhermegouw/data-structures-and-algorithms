Challenge: Array of products
Level: Medium

Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of integers and returns an
array of the same lenght, where each element in the output array is equal to
the product of every other number in the input array.
In other words, the value at output[i] is equal to the product of every number
in the input array other than input[i].
Note: You're expected to solve this problem without using division.

Input:
array = [5, 1, 4, 2]

Output:
[8, 40, 10, 20]
