Challenge: Count Squares
Level: Hard

Write a function that takes in a list of Cartesian coordinates (i.e.,(x, y)
coodinates) and returns the number of squares that can be formed by these
coordinates.
A square must have its four corners amongst the coordinates in order to be
counted. A single coordinate can be used as a corner for multiple different
squares.
You can also assume that no coordinate will be farther than 100 units from the
origin.

Input:
points = [
  [1, 1],
  [0, 0],
  [-4, 2],
  [-2, -1],
  [0, 1],
  [1, 0],
  [-1, 4],
]

Output: // [1, 1], [0, 0], [0, 1], and [1, 0] makes a square,
        // as does [1, 1], [-4, 2], [-2, -1], and [-1, 4]
