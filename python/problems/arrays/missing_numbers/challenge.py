Challenge: Missing Numbers
Level: Medium

You're given an unordered list of unique integers nums in the range [1, n],
where n represent the length of nums + 2. This means that two numbers in this
range are missing from the list.
Write a function that takes in this list and returns a new list with the two
missing numbers, sorted numerically.

Input:
nums = [1, 4, 3]

Output:
[2, 5] // n is 5, meaning the completed list should be [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
