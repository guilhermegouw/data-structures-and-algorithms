Challenge: Validate Subsequence
Level: Easy

Description:
Given two-non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines
whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.

A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that aren't necessarily adjacent
in the array but that are in the same order as they appear in the array.
For instance:
The numbers [1, 3, 4] form a subsequence of the array [1, 2, 3, 4], and so the
numbers [2, 4]. Note that a single number in an array and the array itself are
both balid subsequences of the array.

Input:
array = [ 5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10]
sequence = [1, 6, -1, 10]

Output:
True
