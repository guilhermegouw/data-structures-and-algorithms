Challenge: Longest Subarray With Sum
Level: Hard

Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of non-negative integers and
a non-negative integer representing a target sum. The function should find the
longest subarray where the values collectively sum up to equal the target sum.
Return an array containing the starting index and ending index of this
subarray, both inclusive.
If there is no subarray that sums up to the target sum, the function should
return an empty array. You can assume that the given inputs will only ever have
one answer.

Input:
array = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 3, 1, 2, 1, 2]
target_sum = 10

Output: [4, 8]
