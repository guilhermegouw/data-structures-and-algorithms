Challenge: Common Characters
Level: Easy

Write a function that takes in a non-empty list of non-empty strings and
returns a list of characters that are common to all strings in the list,
ignoring multiplicity.

Note that the strings are not guarantee to only contain alphanumeric
characters. The list you return can be in any order.

    strings = ["abc", "bcd", "cbaccd"]
Output:
    ["b", "c"]  // The characters could be ordered differently.
