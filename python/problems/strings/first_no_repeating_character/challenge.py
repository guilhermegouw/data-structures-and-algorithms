"""
Challenge: First Non-Repeating Character
Level: Easy

Write a function that takes in a string of lowercase English-alphabet letters
and returns the index of the string's first non-repeating character.

The first non-repeating character is the first character in a string that
occurs only once.

If the input string doesn't have any non-repeating characters, your function
should return -1.

Input:
    string = "abcdcaf"
Output:
    1  // The first non-repeating character is "b" and is found at index 1.
