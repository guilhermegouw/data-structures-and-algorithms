Challenge: Reverse Words In String
Level: Medium

Write a function that takes in a string of words separated by one or more
whitespaces and returns a string that has these words in reverse order.

For example, given the string "tim is great", your function should return
"great is tim".

For this problem, a word can contain special characters, punctuation, and
numbers. The words in the string will be separated by one or more whitespaces,
and the reversed string must contain the same whitespaces as the original
string.
For example, given the string "whitespaces     4" you would be expected to
return "4     whitespaces".

Note that you're note allowed to used any built-in `split` or `reverse`
methods/functions. However you're allowed to use built-in `join`
method/function.
Also note that the input string isn't guaranteed to always contain words.

Input:
    string = " Algoexpert is the best!"
Output:
    "best! the is Algoexpert"
