Challenge: Group Anagrams
Level: Medium

Write a function that takes in an array of strings and groups anagrams
together.

Anagrams are strings made up of exactly the same letters, where order doesn't
matter. For example, "cinema" and "iceman" ara anagrams; similarly "foo" and
"ofo" are anagrams.

Your function should return a list of anagram groups in no particular order.

Input:
    words = ["yo", "act", "flop", "tac", "foo", "cat", "oy", "olfp"]
Output:
    [["yo", "oy"], ["flop", "olfp"], ["act", "tac", "cat"], ["foo"]]
