"""
Challenge: Caesar Cipher Encryptor
Level: Easy

Given a non-empty string of lowercase letters and a non-negative integer
representing a key, write a function that returns a new string obtained by
shifting every letter in the input by k positions in the alphabet, where k is
the key.

Note that letters should "wrap" around the alphabet; in other words, the letter
z shifted by one returns the letter a.

Input:
    string = "xyz"
    key = 2
Output:
    "zab"
